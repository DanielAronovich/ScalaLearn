# Scala-Learn

This is my personal project to learn Scala.


### Goals:
Hands on implementation of all the relevant concepts starting at the bare basics.

### Materials that I am using:

* [Scala at light speed - ](https://github.com/rockthejvm/scala-at-light-speed) Following the youtube videos.
* [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala#courses). Discover how to write elegant code that works the first time it is run.
